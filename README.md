## Setting up the Project

Before geting started, you need the API-Key for the Google Places API. I store Google API Key in the .env file â€” you should too. Please, see .env.example file.

## Some Code tips

- Main SearchLocation component is working with the Google Place Autocomplete API.
- Func loadScript was implemented for dynamic JavaScript for fast page speed load on public pages. It dynamically loads JavaScript files with a callback when finished. 
- Assign the Google Place Map to the autoComplete variable when the component is rendered.
- Listen to the input change whenever a user selects one of the autocomplete suggestions.
- Show the map by location code.
